## Overview

Lighteryou, an AI-powered emotional support platform, was preparing for rapid scale with a projected $1B+ trajectory—but the website and landing flow weren’t telling the story or converting fast enough.

Guava Studio rebuilt the experience end-to-end: clearer messaging hierarchy, conversion-focused IA, and speed optimizations across the stack. We added trust cues, transparent pricing, and frictionless sign-up.

We instrumented event-level analytics and ran rapid A/B tests on headlines, CTAs, and proof sections. The new flow reduced bounce, clarified value, and guided users to activation in fewer steps.

Results followed: +300% website visits, 80% retention, and a +30% lift in sales—setting Lighteryou up with a scalable, testable growth engine.
