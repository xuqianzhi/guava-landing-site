## Overview

Tart-Da—known for French tarts and Basque cakes—set a three-week goal: spark local discovery and lift sales fast with TikTok.

Guava Studio built a platform-native playbook: craveable prep shots, texture close-ups, chef POVs, geo-tags, and “fresh-out-of-the-oven” drops—amplified by a few local food creators.

The sprint worked. In 21 days, TikTok content drove a 20% sales boost, more profile visits and saves, and repeatable content cues Tart-Da now uses for monthly flavor launches.

  On TikTok, taste starts with texture. We storyboarded a three-week shot
  list—knife cuts, custard jiggles, sugar crackle, steam pulls—paced to fast
  hooks, warm grading, and geo-tag + ‘fresh today’ overlays. Speaking TikTok’s
  native language made Tart-Da feel local and irresistible—and it showed up as a
  20% lift.
