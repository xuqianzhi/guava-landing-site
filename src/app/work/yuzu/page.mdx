## Overview

Yuzu launched in May 2024 to popularize Ochazuke in New Jersey’s delivery scene. Early sales averaged ~$300/day, signaling interest but low awareness.

Guava Studio focused on Chinese social platforms and activated a steady creator engine: 20 RedNote KOLs per month. Posts educated, sparked cravings, and normalized Ochazuke as an everyday comfort.

Results compounded quickly: in under two months, daily revenue reached ~$1,500. RedNote alone contributed $1,000+ per day, with 83% of orders from Chinese local customers.

The takeaway: community-native creators + consistent cadence win. Guava’s build–activate–analyze loop turned quiet demand into a daily surge—and offers a repeatable playbook for niche local brands.

  Guava Studio didn’t just market us—they built a community around ochazuke.
  Their 20-KOL RedNote cadence made us discoverable to Chinese local customers
  and took us from ~$300/day to ~$1,500 in under two months—over $1,000/day from
  RedNote alone.
