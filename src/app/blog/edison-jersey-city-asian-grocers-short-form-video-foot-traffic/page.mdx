## 1. The Setup

Two neighborhoods, one question: can short-form video move in-store sales fast? We ran a three-week sprint for specialty grocers and bakeries in Edison and Jersey City using TikTok, Reels, and Rednote—geo-fenced, creator-led, with POS-tracked offers.

<TopTip>
  Getting one of those old-timey punch clocks is a great way to monitor
  attendance while maintaining a fun atmosphere. Expect to hear things like
  “Back at the coalface today!”.

## 2. Local Trial

We seeded eight hyperlocal food creators to post “today-only” drops: shelf tours, price tags, fresh bakes, and bundle deals. Sparked top performers, tagged neighborhoods, and routed links to delivery partners; in-store offers used a reel-only promo code at checkout.

## 3. What Lifted

Short-form didn’t just drive views—it moved baskets.

Quick read: +21% weekend foot traffic • +13% POS sales • +9% avg basket size • 7.6% reel-code redemptions • 190k views across 10 posts. Edison over-indexed on fresh/prepared; Jersey City on bundles and limited flavors.
